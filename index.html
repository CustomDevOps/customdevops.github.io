    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 02-16-2026</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how this mobile application (“the App”) handles information.
      The App is designed to function without collecting, storing, transmitting, or selling personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not collect personal information. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share names,
      email addresses, phone numbers, precise location data, contacts, photos, device identifiers, or any other
      personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The App may store basic settings and operational preferences locally on your device to ensure proper
      functionality. This information remains solely on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
      This data remains until you delete the App or clear the App’s data.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The App may offer a one-time purchase to unlock premium features. All payments are processed securely through
      Google Play. We do not receive or store your payment card details. Google may collect and process
      transaction-related information in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, tracking tools, or external data collection services.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to operate without requesting sensitive device permissions. If permissions are required in
      future updates, they will be used solely for core functionality and not for data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at the same URL with a revised effective date.
    </p>
